# LABBOT2_motor_speed_calibration
Use L9110S full-bridge IC to drive the motor,use the remote ctrller to adjust the speed of the motor.

What the project does
--------------------
Use a remote ctrller to adjust the speed of the motor:  
A+1---->enter forward speed calibration mode.  
A+2---->enter backward speed calibration mode.  
C----->start the motor  
D----->save the data and return to the running mode.  
Why the project is useful
------------------------
Without the speed correction,the toy car may rotate   
to one side due to the speed differential between   
the left motor and the right motor,the toy car   
can go straight forward/backward after the speed of      
the left wheel and the right wheel are adjusted.
